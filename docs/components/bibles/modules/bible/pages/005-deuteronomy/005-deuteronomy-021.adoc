[[v5-21-8]]

^<<v5-21-8,8>>^ Do not hold this against your people Israel, whom you redeemed, O Jehovah, and do not let guilt for innocent blood remain among your people Israel.’ Then the bloodguilt will not be held against them.

[[v5-21-13]]

^<<v5-21-16,16>>^ on the day that he gives his inheritance to his sons, he will not be allowed to treat the son of the loved one as his firstborn at the expense of the son of the unloved one, the firstborn.

[[v5-21-17]]

^<<v5-21-17,17>>^ He should recognize as the firstborn the unloved one’s son by giving him the double portion of everything he has, for that one is the beginning of his procreative power. The right of the firstborn’s position belongs to him.

^<<v5-21-18,18>>^ “If a man has a son who is stubborn and rebellious and he does not obey his father or his mother, and they have tried to correct him but he refuses to listen to them,

[[v5-21-21]]

^<<v5-21-21,21>>^ Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. So you must remove what is bad from your midst, and all Israel will hear and become afraid.

[[v5-21-22]]

^<<v5-21-22,22>>^ “If a man commits a sin deserving the sentence of death and he has been put to death and you have hung him on a stake,

[[v5-21-23]]

^<<v5-21-23,23>>^ his dead body should not remain all night on the stake. Instead, you should be sure to bury him on that day, because the one hung up is something accursed of God, and you should not defile your land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance.
