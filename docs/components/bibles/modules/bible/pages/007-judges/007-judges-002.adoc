^<<v7-2-18,18>>^ Whenever Jehovah did raise up judges for them, Jehovah would be with the judge and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity^&#42;1^ over their groaning caused by those who oppressed them and those who were treating them abusively.
