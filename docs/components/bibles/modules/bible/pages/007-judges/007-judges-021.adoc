=== Judges, 21
// nwt 2013, nwt - New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures

[[v7-21-1]]

^<<v7-21-1,1>>^ Now the men of Israel had sworn this oath in Mizʹpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter to a man from Benjamin as a wife.”

[[v7-21-2]]

^<<v7-21-2,2>>^ Consequently, the people came to Bethʹel and sat there before the true God until evening, crying out and weeping bitterly.

[[v7-21-3]]

^<<v7-21-3,3>>^ And they were saying: “Why, O Jehovah the God of Israel, has this happened in Israel? Why should one tribe be missing today from Israel?”

[[v7-21-4]]

^<<v7-21-4,4>>^ And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings.

[[v7-21-5]]

^<<v7-21-5,5>>^ Then the people of Israel said: “Who of all the tribes of Israel did not come up to assemble before Jehovah?” for they had taken a great oath that anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah would be put to death without fail.

[[v7-21-6]]

^<<v7-21-6,6>>^ So the people of Israel felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin their brother. They said: “Today one tribe has been chopped off from Israel.

[[v7-21-7]]

^<<v7-21-7,7>>^ What should we do to provide wives for those who are left, now that we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives?”

[[v7-21-8]]

^<<v7-21-8,8>>^ They asked: “Who among the tribes of Israel did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah?” It so happened that no one had come from Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad into the camp where the congregation was.

[[v7-21-9]]

^<<v7-21-9,9>>^ When the people were counted, they saw that none of the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad were there.

[[v7-21-10]]

^<<v7-21-10,10>>^ So the assembly sent there 12,000 of the mightiest men. They commanded them: “Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad with the sword, even the women and the children.

[[v7-21-11]]

^<<v7-21-11,11>>^ This is what you should do: Every male, as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male, you should devote to destruction.”

[[v7-21-12]]

^<<v7-21-12,12>>^ Among the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, they found 400 girls who were virgins, who had never had sexual relations with a man. So they brought them to the camp at Shiʹloh, which is in the land of Caʹnaan.

[[v7-21-13]]

^<<v7-21-13,13>>^ Then all the assembly sent a message to the Benʹja·min·ites on the crag of Rimʹmon and offered them peace.

[[v7-21-14]]

^<<v7-21-14,14>>^ So Benjamin came back at that time. They gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, but they did not find enough for them.

[[v7-21-15]]

^<<v7-21-15,15>>^ And the people felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin because Jehovah had made a division among the tribes of Israel.

[[v7-21-16]]

^<<v7-21-16,16>>^ The elders of the assembly said: “What should we do to provide wives for the remaining men, since all the women were annihilated out of Benjamin?”

[[v7-21-17]]

^<<v7-21-17,17>>^ They replied: “There should be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out of Israel.

[[v7-21-18]]

^<<v7-21-18,18>>^ But we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters, because the people of Israel have sworn: ‘Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”

[[v7-21-19]]

^<<v7-21-19,19>>^ Then they said: “Look! There is a festival of Jehovah from year to year in Shiʹloh, which is north of Bethʹel and east of the highway that goes up from Bethʹel to Sheʹchem and south of Le·boʹnah.”

[[v7-21-20]]

^<<v7-21-20,20>>^ So they commanded the men of Benjamin: “Go and set an ambush in the vineyards.

[[v7-21-21]]

^<<v7-21-21,21>>^ And when you see the young women^&#42;1^ of Shiʹloh come out to join in their circle dances, each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of Shiʹloh, and you should return to the land of Benjamin.

[[v7-21-22]]

^<<v7-21-22,22>>^ And should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us, we will then tell them, ‘Show us favor for their sakes, because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty.’”

[[v7-21-23]]

^<<v7-21-23,23>>^ So the men of Benjamin did just that, and they each carried off a wife from the women who were dancing. After that they went back to their inheritance and rebuilt their cities and settled in them.

[[v7-21-24]]

^<<v7-21-24,24>>^ And the Israelites dispersed from there at that time, each one to his tribe and his family, and they departed from there, each one to his inheritance.

[[v7-21-25]]

^<<v7-21-25,25>>^ In those days there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.^&#42;1^
