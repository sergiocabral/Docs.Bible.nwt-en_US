[[v11-17-8]]

^<<v11-17-8,8>>^ The word of Jehovah then came to him:

[[v11-17-9]]

^<<v11-17-9,9>>^ “Rise up, go to Zarʹe·phath, which belongs to Siʹdon, and stay there. Look! I will command a widow there to supply you with food.”

[[v11-17-10]]

^<<v11-17-10,10>>^ So he rose up and went to Zarʹe·phath. When he came to the entrance of the city, there was a widow gathering pieces of wood. So he called to her and said: “Please, bring me a little water in a cup so that I may drink.”

[[v11-17-11]]

^<<v11-17-11,11>>^ As she went to get it, he called to her: “Please, bring me a piece of bread in your hand.”

^<<v11-17-12,12>>^ At this she said: “As surely as Jehovah your God is living, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar. Now I am gathering a few pieces of wood, and I will go in and make something for me and my son. After we have eaten, we will die.”

[[v11-17-13]]

^<<v11-17-13,13>>^ Then E·liʹjah said to her: “Do not be afraid. Go in and do as you said. But first make me a small round loaf of bread with what is there, and bring it out to me. Then you can make something afterward for you and your son.

[[v11-17-14]]

^<<v11-17-14,14>>^ For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: ‘The large jar of flour will not run out, and the small jar of oil will not run dry until the day Jehovah makes it rain on the surface of the ground.’”

[[v11-17-18]]

^<<v11-17-18,18>>^ At this she said to E·liʹjah: “What do you have against me,^&#42;1^ O man of the true God? Have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death?”
