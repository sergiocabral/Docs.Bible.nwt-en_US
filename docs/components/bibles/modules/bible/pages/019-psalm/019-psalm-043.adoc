=== Psalm, 43
// nwt 2013, nwt - New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures

[[v19-43-1]]

^<<v19-43-1,1>>^ Judge me, O God,
Defend my legal case against a disloyal nation.
Rescue me from the man of deception and unrighteousness.

[[v19-43-2]]

^<<v19-43-2,2>>^ For you are my God, my fortress.
Why have you cast me off?
Why must I walk about sad because of the oppression by my enemy?

[[v19-43-3]]

^<<v19-43-3,3>>^ Send out your light and your truth.
May these lead me;
May they guide me to your holy mountain and to your grand tabernacle.

[[v19-43-4]]

^<<v19-43-4,4>>^ Then I will come to the altar of God,
To God, my exceeding joy.
And I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.

[[v19-43-5]]

^<<v19-43-5,5>>^ Why am I^&#42;1^ in despair?
Why is this turmoil within me?
Wait for God,
For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior and my God.
