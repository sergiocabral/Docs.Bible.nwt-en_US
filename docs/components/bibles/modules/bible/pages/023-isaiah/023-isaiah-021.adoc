^<<v23-21-2,2>>^ A harsh vision has been told to me:
The treacherous one is acting treacherously,
And the destroyer is destroying.
Go up, O Eʹlam! Lay siege, O Meʹdi·a!
I will put an end to all the sighing she caused.

[[v23-21-3]]

^<<v23-21-3,3>>^ That is why I am in great anguish.^&#42;1^
Convulsions have seized me,
Like those of a woman giving birth.

I am too disturbed to see.

A war chariot of donkeys,
A war chariot of camels.
He watched carefully, with great attentiveness.

“Upon the watchtower, O Jehovah, I am standing constantly by day,
And I am stationed at my guardpost every night.

[[v23-21-9]]

^<<v23-21-9,9>>^ Look at what is coming:
Men in a war chariot with a team of horses!”

“She has fallen! Babylon has fallen!
All the graven images of her gods he has shattered to the ground!”

[[v23-21-10]]

^<<v23-21-10,10>>^ O my people who have been threshed,
The product^&#42;1^ of my threshing floor,

You inhabitants of the land of Teʹma,
And bring bread for the one fleeing.

[[v23-21-15]]

^<<v23-21-15,15>>^ For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword,
From the bent bow, and from the cruelty of the war.

[[v23-21-16]]

^<<v23-21-16,16>>^ For this is what Jehovah said to me: “Within one year, like the years of a hired worker,^&#42;1^ all the glory of Keʹdar will come to an end.
