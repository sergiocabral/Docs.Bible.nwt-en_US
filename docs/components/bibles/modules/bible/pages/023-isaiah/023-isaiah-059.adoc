^<<v23-59-1,1>>^ Look! The hand of Jehovah is not too short to save,
Nor is his ear too dull^&#42;1^ to hear.

[NOTE]
====
. Lit., “heavy.”
====

[[v23-59-2]]

^<<v23-59-2,2>>^ No, your own errors have separated you from your God.
Your sins have made him hide his face from you,
And he refuses to hear you.

[[v23-59-3]]

^<<v23-59-3,3>>^ For your palms are polluted with blood
And your fingers with error.
Your lips speak lies, and your tongue mutters unrighteousness.

[[v23-59-4]]

^<<v23-59-4,4>>^ No one calls out for righteousness,
And no one goes to court in truthfulness.
They trust in unreality^&#42;1^ and speak what is worthless.
They conceive trouble and give birth to what is harmful.

[NOTE]
====
. Or “emptiness.”
====

[[v23-59-5]]

^<<v23-59-5,5>>^ They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake,
And they weave the cobweb of a spider.
Anyone who eats their eggs would die,
And the egg that is crushed hatches a viper.

[[v23-59-6]]

^<<v23-59-6,6>>^ Their cobweb will not serve as a garment,
Nor will they cover themselves with what they make.
Their works are harmful,
And deeds of violence are in their hands.

[[v23-59-7]]

^<<v23-59-7,7>>^ Their feet run to do evil,
And they hurry to shed innocent blood.
Their thoughts are harmful thoughts;
Ruin and misery are in their ways.

[[v23-59-8]]

^<<v23-59-8,8>>^ They have not known the way of peace,
And there is no justice in their tracks.
They make their roadways crooked;
No one treading on them will know peace.

[[v23-59-9]]

^<<v23-59-9,9>>^ That is why justice is far away from us,
And righteousness does not overtake us.
We keep hoping for light, but look! there is darkness;
For brightness, but we keep walking in gloom.

[[v23-59-10]]

^<<v23-59-10,10>>^ We grope for the wall like blind men;
Like those without eyes we keep groping.
We stumble at high noon as in evening darkness;
Among the strong we are just like the dead.

[[v23-59-11]]

^<<v23-59-11,11>>^ We all keep growling like bears
And cooing mournfully like doves.
We hope for justice, but there is none;
For salvation, but it is far away from us.

[[v23-59-12]]

^<<v23-59-12,12>>^ For our revolts are many before you;
Each of our sins testifies against us.
For our revolts are with us;
We well know our errors.

[[v23-59-13]]

^<<v23-59-13,13>>^ We have transgressed and denied Jehovah;
We have turned our backs on our God.
We have spoken of oppression and revolt;
We have conceived lies and muttered false words from the heart.

[[v23-59-14]]

^<<v23-59-14,14>>^ Justice is driven back,
And righteousness stands far off;
For truth^&#42;1^ has stumbled in the public square,
And what is upright is unable to enter.

[NOTE]
====
. Or “honesty.”
====

[[v23-59-15]]

^<<v23-59-15,15>>^ Truth^&#42;1^ has vanished,
And anyone who turns away from bad is plundered.
Jehovah saw this and was displeased,^&#42;2^
For there was no justice.

[NOTE]
====
. Or “honesty.”
. Lit., “and it was bad in his eyes.”
====

[[v23-59-16]]

^<<v23-59-16,16>>^ He saw that there was no man,
And he was astonished that no one interceded,
So his own arm brought about salvation,^&#42;1^
And his own righteousness supported him.

[NOTE]
====
. Or “victory for him.”
====

[[v23-59-17]]

^<<v23-59-17,17>>^ Then he put on righteousness like a coat of mail
And the helmet of salvation^&#42;1^ on his head.
He put on the garments of vengeance as his clothing
And wrapped himself with zeal like a coat.^&#42;2^

[NOTE]
====
. Or “victory.”
. Or “sleeveless coat.”
====

[[v23-59-18]]

^<<v23-59-18,18>>^ He will reward them for what they have done:
Wrath to his adversaries, retribution to his enemies.
And to the islands he will repay their due.

[[v23-59-19]]

^<<v23-59-19,19>>^ From the sunset they will fear the name of Jehovah
And from the sunrise his glory,
For he will come in like a rushing river,
Which the spirit of Jehovah drives along.

[[v23-59-20]]

^<<v23-59-20,20>>^ “To Zion the Repurchaser will come,
To those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares Jehovah.

[[v23-59-21]]

^<<v23-59-21,21>>^ “As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says Jehovah. “My spirit that is on you and my words that I have placed in your mouth—they will not be removed from your mouth, from the mouth of your children,^&#42;1^ or from the mouth of your grandchildren,”^&#42;2^ says Jehovah, “from now on and forever.”
