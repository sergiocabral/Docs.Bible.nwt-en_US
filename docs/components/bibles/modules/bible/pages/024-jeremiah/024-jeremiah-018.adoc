Their young men struck down with the sword in battle.

^<<v24-18-22,22>>^ Let a cry be heard from their houses
When you bring marauders on them suddenly.

And have laid traps for my feet.

^<<v24-18-23,23>>^ But you, O Jehovah,
Well know all their schemes against me to kill me.
Do not cover their error,
And do not wipe out their sin from before you.
Let them stumble before you
When you take action against them in your anger.
