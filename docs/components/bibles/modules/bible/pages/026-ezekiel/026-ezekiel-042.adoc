[[v26-42-5]]

^<<v26-42-5,5>>^ The upper dining rooms of the building were narrower than those in the lower and middle stories, because the galleries took up more of their space.

[[v26-42-6]]

^<<v26-42-6,6>>^ For they were three stories high, but they had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. That is why more floor space was taken away from them than from the lower and middle stories.

[[v26-42-11]]

^<<v26-42-11,11>>^ There was a walkway before them like that of the northern dining rooms. They were the same length and width, and they had the same exits and layouts. Their entrances

[[v26-42-12]]

^<<v26-42-12,12>>^ were like the entrances of the dining rooms that were toward the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the walkway, before the adjacent stone wall toward the east, where one could enter.

[[v26-42-13]]

^<<v26-42-13,13>>^ Then he said to me: “The dining rooms of the north and the dining rooms of the south that are next to the open area are the holy dining rooms where the priests who are approaching Jehovah eat the most holy offerings. There they place the most holy offerings, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, because the place is holy.

[[v26-42-14]]

^<<v26-42-14,14>>^ When the priests enter, they should not go out of the holy place to the outer courtyard without first removing the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They will clothe themselves with other garments in order to approach the areas permitted to the people.”

[[v26-42-20]]
