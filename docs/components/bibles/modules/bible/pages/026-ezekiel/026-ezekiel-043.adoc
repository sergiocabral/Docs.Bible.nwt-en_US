[[v26-43-2]]

^<<v26-43-2,2>>^ There I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters; and the earth was illuminated by his glory.

[[v26-43-3]]

^<<v26-43-3,3>>^ What I saw was like the vision I had seen when I^&#42;1^ came to bring the city to ruin, and it appeared to be like what I had seen near the river Cheʹbar; and I fell with my face to the ground.

“Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the people of Israel forever.

[[v26-43-8]]

^<<v26-43-8,8>>^ By putting their threshold next to my threshold and their doorpost beside my doorpost, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by the detestable things they did, so I exterminated them in my anger.

^<<v26-43-18,18>>^ He then said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘These are the directions to follow when the altar is made, so that whole burnt offerings may be offered and blood may be sprinkled on it.’

[[v26-43-25]]

^<<v26-43-25,25>>^ For seven days you will offer a male goat as a daily sin offering, as well as a young bull of the herd and a ram of the flock; you will offer unblemished^&#42;1^ animals.
