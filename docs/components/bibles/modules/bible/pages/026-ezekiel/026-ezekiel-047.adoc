[[v26-47-1]]

^<<v26-47-1,1>>^ Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and there I saw water flowing eastward from under the threshold of the temple, for the front of the temple was facing east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.

[[v26-47-2]]

^<<v26-47-2,2>>^ He then led me out by way of the north gate and took me outside and around to the outer gate that is facing east, and I saw water trickling from the right side.

[[v26-47-5]]

^<<v26-47-5,5>>^ When he measured off another 1,000, it was a torrent that I was unable to walk across, for the water was so deep that one had to swim, a torrent of water that could not be crossed on foot.

[[v26-47-8]]

[[v26-47-9]]

^<<v26-47-9,9>>^ Swarms of living creatures^&#42;1^ will be able to live wherever the waters^&#42;2^ flow. There will be an abundance of fish, because this water will flow there. The seawater will be healed, and everything will live wherever the stream goes.

[[v26-47-10]]

[[v26-47-12]]

^<<v26-47-12,12>>^ “All sorts of trees for food will grow on both banks of the stream. Their leaves will not wither; nor will their fruitage fail. Each month they will bear new fruit, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruitage will serve as food and their leaves for healing.”

[[v26-47-13]]

^<<v26-47-13,13>>^ This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “This is the territory that you will assign as the land inheritance of the 12 tribes of Israel, and Joseph will have two portions.

[[v26-47-17]]

^<<v26-47-17,17>>^ So the boundary will run from the sea to Haʹzar-eʹnon, along the boundary of Damascus to the north, and the boundary of Haʹmath. This is the northern border.
