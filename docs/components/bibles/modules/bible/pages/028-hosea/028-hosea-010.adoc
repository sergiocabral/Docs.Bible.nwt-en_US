When their two errors are harnessed on them.^&#42;1^

[[v28-10-11]]

^<<v28-10-11,11>>^ Eʹphra·im was a trained heifer that loved to thresh,
So I spared her fair neck.

[[v28-10-12]]

Plow for yourselves arable land
While there is time to search for Jehovah,
Until he comes and instructs you in righteousness.

You have reaped unrighteousness,
And you have eaten the fruitage of deception;
For you have trusted in your own way,
In the multitude of your warriors.

[[v28-10-14]]

^<<v28-10-14,14>>^ An uproar will rise against your people,
And your fortified cities will all be devastated,
Like the devastation by Shalʹman of the house of Arʹbel,
In the day of battle when mothers were dashed to pieces alongside their children.

[[v28-10-15]]

^<<v28-10-15,15>>^ This is what will be done to you, O Bethʹel, because of your utter wickedness.
At dawn the king of Israel will surely be done away with.”^&#42;1^
