A day of clouds and thick gloom,
Like light of dawn spreading out on the mountains.

And never again will there be another
Through the years of all generations.

[[v29-2-3]]

And nothing can escape.

And they run like warhorses.

Every face will grow flushed.

And they do not swerve from their paths.

And the stars have lost their brightness.

The foul smell from him will ascend,
The stench from him will keep ascending;
