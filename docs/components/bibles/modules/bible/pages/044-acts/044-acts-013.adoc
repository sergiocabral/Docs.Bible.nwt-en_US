^<<v44-13-13,13>>^ Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paʹphos and arrived at Perga in Pam·phylʹi·a. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem.

[[v44-13-14]]

^<<v44-13-14,14>>^ However, they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pi·sidʹi·a. And going into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they took a seat.

[[v44-13-15]]

^<<v44-13-15,15>>^ After the public reading of the Law and the Prophets, the presiding officers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying: “Men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, tell it.”

[[v44-13-16]]

[[v44-13-39]]

[[v44-13-43]]

[[v44-13-46]]

^<<v44-13-46,46>>^ Then Paul and Barʹna·bas boldly said to them: “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are rejecting it and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations.

[[v44-13-47]]

^<<v44-13-47,47>>^ For Jehovah^&#42;1^ has commanded us in these words: ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the ends of the earth.’”

[[v44-13-50]]

^<<v44-13-50,50>>^ But the Jews incited the prominent women who were God-fearing and the principal men of the city, and they stirred up persecution against Paul and Barʹna·bas and threw them outside their boundaries.

[[v44-13-51]]

^<<v44-13-51,51>>^ So they shook the dust off their feet against them and went to I·coʹni·um.

[[v44-13-52]]
