[[v61-2-1]]

^<<v61-2-1,1>>^ However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you. These will quietly bring in destructive sects, and they will even disown the owner who bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.

[[v61-2-3]]

[[v61-2-6]]

[[v61-2-9]]

^<<v61-2-9,9>>^ So, then, Jehovah^&#42;1^ knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people to be destroyed^&#42;2^ on the day of judgment,

^<<v61-2-12,12>>^ But these men, like unreasoning animals that act on instinct and are born^&#42;1^ to be caught and destroyed, speak abusively about things of which they are ignorant. They will suffer destruction brought on by their own destructive course,

[NOTE]
====

====

[[v61-2-13]]

^<<v61-2-13,13>>^ suffering harm as their reward for their own harmful course.

[[v61-2-20]]

^<<v61-2-20,20>>^ Certainly if after escaping from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, their final state has become worse for them than the first.

[[v61-2-21]]

[[v61-2-22]]
